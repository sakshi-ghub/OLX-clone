# OLX-clone (Group project)
We wish to Provide the Database requirement for a Platform capable of
Buying and Selling Goods by Users, Chatting in order to Negotiate and Place Order
at Prices that are more competitive, Profiles for different Users depending on their
Roles in this System, Specializations for Product based on different Categories
(Filtering of Products) and some more features and Database Elements, to make the
Interface more Interactive. We also wish to store the data that is being generated
through the exchange over time in a meaningful way, so as to be used for
recommendations, gaining Insights and Trends.
